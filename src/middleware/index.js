In case you forgot
â€¢	Thunks: Thunk middleware can then be used to delay an action dispatch, 
or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met (e.g., a request is resolved). 
This logic lives inside action creators rather than inside components. Middleware 
like thunk helps support asynchronicity in a Redux application. Without thunks, 
synchronous dispatches are the default. We could still make API calls from React components
 (e.g., using the componentDidMount() lifecycle method to make these requests) -- 
 but using thunk middleware gives us a cleaner separation of concerns. Components don't need to 
 handle what happens after an asynchronous call, since API logic is moved away from components to action creators.
